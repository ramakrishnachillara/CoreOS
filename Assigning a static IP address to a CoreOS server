1. SSH to your CoreOS server using the DHCP given IP address that is displayed on the CoreOS console.

2. Once in the Core os server, Navigate to the /etc/systed/network directory.

3. Type in the ifconfig command to get the adapter name

3. Create a new file called static.network and give it the values that desired.

cd /etc/systemd/network
sudo vim static.network
[Match]
Name=enp2s4

[Network]
Address=192.168.1.200/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
DNS=8.8.8.8
DNS=8.8.4.4
4. Save the file and reboot the server. When the server comes back up, 
it should have the IP address that you defined in your static.network file.
