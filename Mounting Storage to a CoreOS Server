1. SSH to your CoreOS server using the DHCP given IP address that is displayed on the CoreOS console.

2. Once in the Core os server, Navigate to the /mnt/ directory and create a folder that you will use to mount the storage

cd /mnt/
sudo mkdir container_storage
3. Change directories into the /etc/systemd/system directory.

cd /etc/systemd/system/
4. Create a new file called mnt-container_storage.
* the mnt-name MUST match the name of the folder created in /mnt/

cd /etc/systemd/system
sudo vim mnt-container_storage
* The following example assumes that the disk that you want mounted to /mnt/container_storage is:
** /dev/sdb1
** File System is EXT4
** Substitute these values with the actual properties of your disk.

[Unit]
Description = Mount for Container Storage

[Mount]
What=/dev/sdb1
Where=/mnt/container_storage
Type=ext4

[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target
5. Save the file and enable and start the unit file

sudo systemctl enable mnt-container_storage.mount
sudo systemctl start mnt-container_storage.mount
6. Verify that the storage is mounted

df -h

Filesystem     Size     Used     Avail     Use%     Mounted on
rootfs         28G      28M      28G       1%       /
tmpfs          993M      0       993M      0%       /dev
etc...
/dev/sdb1      30G       44M     28G        1%      /mnt/container_storage

5. Reboot the server. When the server comes back up, it should have the storage mounted.
